Data view hooks provide a predefined solution to manage state of the data view. This modular approach allows them to be easily replaced with a custom implementation in case of more specific needs.

### useDataViewPagination()

The `useDataViewPagination` hook manages the pagination state of the data view. It retrieves the current `page` and `perPage` values together with functions to set them (`setPage`, `setPerPage`)

Coming soon...
